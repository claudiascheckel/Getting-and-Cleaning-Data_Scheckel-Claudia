==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. The dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

Column 1 contains the Subject ID
Column 2 contains the activity that was measured
Column 3 contains information if the Subject was part of the test or training group.
Columns 4-89 contain the mean of each variable (see below) for each Subject for each activity.

======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time (t) and frequency (f) domain variables. 

The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X/Y and Z axes in standard gravity units 'g'.
The body acceleration signal was obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 

======================================

Using accelerometer and gyroscope embedded in the smartphone, a 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz was captured. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.
